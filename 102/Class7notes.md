# Class 7 notes

## Reflection and Discussion

### Control flow

 - The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
 - Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

 ## JavaScript Function Syntax

- Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

## Function Invocation

- The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

## Things i want to learn nore about

- Having trouble understanding java
- better understanding of variables and constants
- Function invocation
