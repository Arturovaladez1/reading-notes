# Class 6 notes

## Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

- JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. 

## Embed or include

- You can either embed the JavaScript code directly inside the HTML file, or you can put a line in the HTML file that will include the external JavaScript file. In most cases the latter is recommended, but for our first examples, in order to make the whole thing work in a single file, we'll embed the JavaScript code inside some HTML. 

## Variables

- *Variables* are containers for storing data.
- always declare variables with const if they are going to remain constant
- If the value of the variable can change, use *let*
- In programming, text values are called text strings.

## things i want to know more about
