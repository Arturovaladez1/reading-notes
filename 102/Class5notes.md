## What is CSS

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.

## CSS syntax

- CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

## Three ways of inserting a style sheet:

- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS

## External CSS

- With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!


## Internal CSS

- An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

## Inline CSS

- An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

- To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

## CSS Tools: Reset CSS 

- The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.
