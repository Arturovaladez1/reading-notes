### Choosing A Text Editor

- Using certain Text editors and choosing a text editor I think comes down to preference.
Some text editing software comes with features that other text editing
software does not. But for the most part, theyâ€™re all pretty similar.

- A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser.

- A text editor allows you to write and manage text that you write
to build a web site

- Some computers come with a built in Text editor but most of them are bare bones.

- There are many options when choosing a text editor, just do your research to choose the one that best suits your needs.

- IDE is a text editor but with much more to offer, it is a software that can have much utilization. Though it require a bit more knowledge to operate, it can be a great tool.

### Some features you should keep an eye out for!

- Code completion 
- Syntax highlighting 
- Variety of themes
- Ability to choose selection of
  extensions. 
- Emmet extension which helps with writing html and css
- Code completion which saves time while writing code.
- Syntax Highlighting which differentiates attributes from elements.

### The Command Line

- A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. 
- You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
- Opening a terminal is easy. for mac its 'command + space' or its under utilities> terminal. 
  For linux its Applications> system or right click and choose terminal.
- Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. 
- A shell defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you.
- Most common shell is called *Bash* but there are others.



### Basic Navigation

#### Cheat sheet
- pwd: Print Working Directory. (Make use of this command often so as to remind yourself where you presently are).
- ls: list. ( just do a plain listing of our current location).
- tree: Visual representation of information
- cntrl c: stop command
- mkdir: make directory 
- ls -a: Hidden files
- cd foler-name: change directory to specific folder
- cd: Change directory takes you to home directory
- cd .. takes you back to parent directory or back.
- ls -l: list things one at a time
- touch: New file in location
- Tree: shows structure of your files.
- code . launches the code editor (vs code) in the current directory.
