# Class 3 Reading notes

This topic matters because I am learning how to code and use javaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## Learn HTML

### List and Unordered lists

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

- Grouping of items that do not have a numerical order and their order is meaningless.

2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

- CSS using the list-style-type property.

3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

- If you need something listed in order you can use ol, if there is no order needed then use ul. Examples like steps in recipe, directions, list of schools listed by rankings.

4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

- Using Roman numeral types by using
<!-- type="i" -->
- Using Start attribute by using
<!-- start="number" -->

## Learn CSS

### The box model

1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

- Margin are the parents in the story.
- Padding are the couple in the story.
- Therefore the border between is the space needed to have a happy relationship.
Still part together as one but seperated to avoid conflict.

2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

- Content box is in the center of the box.
- Padding is the box around the content.
- Border is the box around the padding.
- Margin is the box around the padding.

## Learn JS

### arrays, Operators, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?

- strings, numbers, objects, and other arrays.

2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

- It is valid, because you can store strings, numbers, and objects.

3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

- Assignment = is used to assign value to a variable.

- Logical && only assigns if the operator is truthy, if its falsy it will not assign a value or trigger.

- Logical || only assigns if one of the expression is true.

- Exponentiation assignment ** raises the value of a variable to the power of the right operand.

- Addition assignment (+=) adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable. Also can lead to concatenation.

4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

- 

5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

- When a person opens the maps app it should display the map diagram and images.

6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.

When you want to run a line of code multiple times and instead of writing it each time you can use a loop to run the code until it breaks out and the condition is met.

## Notes

## Primatives

- The building blocks of larger or more comples data types, structures.

- Basic form of data.

## Data type

- a way of formatting thr daya that the computer can anticipate.

- Booleans
the logival data type and it can be true or false

- null
specifically defined as none, nothing or null.

- undefined
a primitive value that is assigned to variables when no other is assigned.

typeof : gives you the data type.

parseInt: to figure out what it is, extracts number for a string. Looks for a nu,mber

- kebob case lowercase with dash hello-world
