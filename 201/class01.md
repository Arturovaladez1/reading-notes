### How the web works

- Client: Computer or device connected to the internet.
- Server: Store webpages, sites or apps (data).
- Client request to server: A copy is downloaded and sent from the server to the clients browser.
- Tcp/ip: How the information should travel across the Internet.
- Dns: Addressbook for websites.
- Websites: Have an IP Address that lives in the DNS.
- Componenet files: Website is made of diferent type of files. There are two main styles of files. Code files and assets.
Code files: like hitml, css, javascript.
- Assets: PDFS,JPGS,WORD DOCUMENTS ETC.

### Website design and progress

- First plan, what purpose does your site have?
- What information are you presenting.
- Aesthetics.
- Next sketch your website.
- Choose assets and start planning.
- Pick some colors grab the hexcodes.
- Save images.
- Choose a font you want to work with.

### JavaScript

- Adds interactivity to your website.
- 3D, 2D, Animation, Apps.
- Variables are containers that store value.
- Declare these variables by using *let (name or keyword);
- ; to end a statement.
- Variables are case sensitive and must match.
- multiply in JS is a asterisk *.
- = assigns a value to a variable.

## Assignment 1 getting started

1. Poem

- The requests was made from her desk
Late night she was eating a croissant awaiting a response
As the html file was found, the file was parsed and unbound
The webpage was glorious and profound
The neighbors were concerned with the sound
She jumped and laughed with joy as her work could now be finished.

2. HTML, CSS, JS files Parsed

- First the request is made from the client to the server. After the request is made the server to fetch the HTML File that represents the page, then it parses the file. Once the client recognizes these html, css, js elements, it sends a requests for the files in these js and css files and parses them.

3. Finding images on website

- One way to find images is  using google images and clicking the copyright license to make sure you can use it without violating the copyright restrictions.

4. Creating Strings and numbers

- Strings are any word or number within single or double quotes.

- Numbers can be written without quotes around them.

5. Variable

- Containers that store values.
- You can declare a value by using the *let keyword followed by the name you gave the variable.
- A semicolon indicates where a statement ends.

## Assignment 2 intro to html

1. Html attribute

- Attributes are used to add extra information to an element.

2. Anatomy of an html element

- Openeing tags: consists of the name of the element wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets.

- Content: content of the element.

- Closing tags: same as opening tag but includes a forward slash before the angle bracket. this marks where the element ends.

3. Website elements

<!-- - <article>:  -->
Block of related content.

<!-- - <section>:  -->
Similar to a article but groups together a single part of the page that constitutes one single peice of functionality.

4. Typical website elements

- A website usually has a head, navigation bar, body, main content, footer.

5. Metadata influence search engine optimization.

- Metadata gives information about data, sort of like a category for abook. It can use that information to know what the client is going to most likely be requesting. 

6. Meta html tag used when specyfying metadata

- Html adds metadata to a document by using the meta tag element. Many different meta elements that can be added to the page's head. 

- Many meta elements include name and content.

## Assignment 3 How to start design a website

1. First step is to create a framework of what you want the website to look like and its assets. Goals and visions(Project Ideation).

2. What do you want to accomplish?

## Assignment 4 Semantics

1. h1 VS Span

- Because you should code html to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its presentation styling. Presentation is done in CSS. Span can render something to look like a heading but holds no semantic value.

2. Benefits of using semantic tags in html

- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's SEO.

- Help visually impaired users navigate a page.

- Finding blocks of meaningful code is easier.

- Suggests to developer what type of data will be populated.

- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming.

## Assignment 5 What is JavaScript?

1. 2 things that require JavaScript in the browser?

- Interactive webpage by running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.

- Storing useful information inside variables.

2. How can you add JavaScript to an HTML document?

- Add it by creating a script tag before closing your head tag.
