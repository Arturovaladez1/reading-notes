## Psychological Safety

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

being able to be open with one another and having a relationship outside of work.
enthusiasm for one anotherâ€™s ideas, joking around and having fun.

2.Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

Ive always had a good experience with working in teams to be honest, its usually when people believe they are smarter than one another, that it makes it harder to be creative and brainstorm. In the past I worked in a group of people who maintained a navy vessels ship firefighting capabilities. we worked to maintain and repair all the systems throughout the ship. In my experience there is always more than one way to do things so we found it easy to work together to devise the best plan to execute our tasks by allowing the floor to be open to new methods or ideas. By allowing poeple to be open and taking part in the bigger picture, results were more effective.

3.What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

 groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.
