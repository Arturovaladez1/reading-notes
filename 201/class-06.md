# Class 6 notes

- This topic matters because it is the hardest part of programming.

## Java Script objects

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

- Object is a storage rack that has many different racks with names and things. The things are called values and the names are called keys and each rack is called a property.

2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?

- Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually, and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.

3. How do objects differ from arrays?

- it is easier to work with, instead of using an index number to select a number you are using the. name associated with each members value. THey map string to values in the same waythat arrays map numbers to values.

4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

- if an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value.

5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term *this* refer to and what is the advantage to using *this*?

- object name to acces whats inside the object then after the dot then the item you want to access. to target a speciifc value.

## DOM

1. What is the DOM?

- programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

- he DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts. The document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells, and all other elements in a document are parts of the document object model for that document. They can all be accessed and manipulated using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.
