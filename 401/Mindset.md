# Mindset

## Deliberate Practice

- Improving your hard technical skills makes all the software you build better. It exposes you to new opportunities, expands your knowledge into multiple fields and ultimately allows you to do more things with computers.

- In this market, you will be rewarded handsomely for building one boring CRUD application after another. To upgrade your hard technical skills however, you'll need to apply deliberate practice.

- Only I know where I lack skill and understanding, It is my responsibility to keep challenging myself and skillsets.

## Carol Dweck Growth mindset

- Running from difficulty doesnt engage your mindset because your accepting failure.

- believing not yet, rather than not, helped students learn.

- Growth is always possible if your mindset is open to process and effort.

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

- Talent does not mean you have grit.

- Growth mindset makes grit.

- Be willing to fail and keep on pushing.\

- successful students were always the students that displayed grit.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

- Never know someones value.

- Cant be successful at everything.

- The idea of success is defined by outside forces.

- Make sure success is your own idea of what that is.

## Emotional intelligence 

- I still need to work on Relationship Management. I think there is alot of uncertainty and feelings of doubt when someone is new to something. Thats exactly how i feel sometimes and it has been difficult to not get down on myself. I am still learning and will continue to do so in this industry. The greatest challenge for me is the mental one.

## your biases

I scored higher than before. I need to get better at being ok with being uncomfortable. I am becoming more open to the idea of we all have the ability to be great, but also we all have different struggles that affect us in different ways. I used to believe just because your from a bad area doesnt mean you dont have the same opportunities. That is kind of the case now, its easier for certain people to do things because it is easily available to them.
