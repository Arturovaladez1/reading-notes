2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

It means objects can listen to events from other objects, meaning you don't need an object to trigger the next action, but rather the next action gets triggered because it hears the event in the object

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

Event driven programming is useful on the backend using Node.js because you wouldn’t want to transmit info when it’s needed to optimize performance, and how you can monitor the “when” is by a particular event. This can optimize data transmission, storage, and UX.
