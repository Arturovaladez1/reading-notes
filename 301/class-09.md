## Functional Programming Concepts 

What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. - wikepedia

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects
It returns the same result if given the same arguments


What are the benefits of a pure function?



What is immutability?

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

What is Referential transparency?

Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

What is a module?

simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node. js application.

What does the word ‘require’ do?

a built-in function to include external modules that exist in separate files. require() statement basically reads a JavaScript file, executes it, and then proceeds to return the export object.

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?



What do we have to do to make a module available?
