## Reminders to keep a Growth Mindset
1. To always strive for success and take failure as a learning experince. I must always keep pushing forward no matter the difficulty.

2. To not allow myself to fall into a negative mindset or pattern. Things dont always come easy and must learn to be patient with the process of learning.

3. Obstacles are something that may cause furstration and often cause me to hit a roadbloack must find a way or atleast a small step in the right direction.
