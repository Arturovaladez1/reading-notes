My reading journal for Code Fellows

## Introduction

My name is Arturo C Valadez, I have no previous experience in tech but I am willing to learn. I am excited to enter a new career path and become a great Software Developer.

## Growth mindset

- A growth mindset is essential to be succesful. A persistent mind will ensure growth and understanding of everything in life.
- Being open minded will also create progress in all things not limited to tech.

## Reminders to keep a Growth Mindset

1. To always strive for success and take failure as a learning experience. I must always keep pushing forward no matter how difficult it may be.

2. To not allow myself to fall into a negative mindset or pattern. Things dont always come easy and must learn to be patient with the process of learning.

3. Obstacles are something that may cause furstration and often cause me to hit a roadbloack. I must find a way or atleast make a small step in the right direction.
